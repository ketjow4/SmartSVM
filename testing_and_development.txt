To set up tests and support incremental development for a Python package with a C++ extension built using CMake, you can follow these steps:

1. Use setup.py for Development
Modify your setup.py to support development installations. This is often done by adding the setuptools.setup() entry with appropriate parameters. For example:

python
Copy code
from setuptools import setup, Extension

setup(
    # ... other setup parameters ...

    ext_modules=[
        Extension(
            # Your extension module details here
        ),
    ],

    # Add this to enable in-place build for development
    zip_safe=False,
)
2. Use pip install -e for Development
Install your package in development mode using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -e .
This installs your package in "editable" mode, meaning changes to your source code take effect immediately without requiring reinstallation.

3. Create a Separate tests Directory
Organize your project by creating a tests directory in the root of your project. Place your test files inside this directory.

4. Use a Testing Framework
Choose a testing framework for Python, such as pytest. Install it using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pytest
5. Write Tests
Write your tests using the chosen testing framework. For example:

python
Copy code
# tests/test_my_module.py

from my_module import some_function

def test_some_function():
    assert some_function(2) == 4
6. Run Tests
Run your tests using the testing framework. For example:

bash
Copy code
pytest tests/
7. Continuous Testing
For continuous testing during development, you might use a tool like pytest-watch:

bash
Copy code
pip install pytest-watch
Run continuous tests:

bash
Copy code
ptw tests/
This will automatically re-run your tests whenever you make changes to the source code.

8. Handle CMake Rebuilds
If you make changes to the C++ code and need to rebuild the extension, you might need to re-run CMake and reinstall the package:

bash
Copy code
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install -e .
This ensures that the changes to the C++ code take effect.

These steps should help you set up a convenient development and testing environment for your Python package with a C++ extension. Adjust them according to your project structure and preferences.
